## Student Performance Prediction System
The Student Performance Prediction System is a machine learning-based solution that predicts student performance using various features. It leverages a CI/CD pipeline and is yet to deployed on Microsoft Azure for automated development, testing, and deployment.

## Overview
The Student Performance Prediction System utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast student performance based on factors such as demographics, previous grades, attendance, and other relevant indicators. By analyzing historical data, the system can provide valuable insights to educators, enabling them to identify students who may require additional support or intervention.

## Architecture
The system architecture is as follows:

* Data Ingestion: The system collects student data from various sources, such as databases, files, or APIs, and performs data ingestion to centralize and prepare the data for analysis.
* Preprocessing: The collected data undergoes preprocessing to clean, transform, and normalize it. Missing values are handled, and feature engineering techniques are applied to extract meaningful information.
* Model Training: Machine learning models, such as regression or classification algorithms, are trained using the preprocessed data. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques are utilized to optimize model performance.
* Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant indicators. This helps validate the models' effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
* Deployment: The best-performing model is deployed on Microsoft Azure using a CI/CD pipeline. This pipeline automates the testing, version control, and deployment processes, ensuring seamless integration with the production environment.
## Getting Started
To get started with the Student Performance Prediction System, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository:
('''git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-prediction.git''')
2.Set up the Python environment with the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

('''cd student-performance-prediction
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Unix/Linux
env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt''')
3.Explore the code and Jupyter notebooks in the repository to understand the data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment steps.

4.Run the notebooks sequentially to execute the code and reproduce the results.
